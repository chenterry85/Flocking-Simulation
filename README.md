# Flocking simulation

Flocking is a simulation where there are boids in flocks. The boids move around and simulate flocking behavior in real life with animals like birds and fish. Boid is short for bird-oid, but they are just generic objects that interact with other boids to form flocks. Each boid follows three behaviors: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

**Separation**: A boid does not want to be too close to other boids.
**Alignment**: A boid wants to move in the same direction as the others.
**Cohesion**: A boid wants to stay close to the other boids.
